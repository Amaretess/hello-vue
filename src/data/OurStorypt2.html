    When the pandemic hit, gaming became everything, and I used my skills to help friends boost their system performance—often making their PCs run better than new. What began as small favors grew into a business, driven by the belief that every gamer deserves great performance at a low cost. Seven years later, that mission hasn’t changed. I know what it’s like to game on a budget, and now, I’m here to make sure no one has to settle for a laggy setup.
